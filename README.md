# DDR3-FlyBy
Purpose of that repo routing and simulating of DDR3 Fly-By.
Im not experienced person about those topics but improved myself about it. 

DDR3 & FPGA demo with Xpedition.
Chips I used in project:
XC7Z020-2CLG484I and two MT41K128M16JT-125.
Topology:
I used flyby topology which is recommended.
I used formulas for routing.
I will share SI result of demo
